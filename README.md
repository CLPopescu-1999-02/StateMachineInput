# StateMachineInput
Keypad Input Validation Using State Machine Programming on Arduino.

You have an project that accepts commands using a 16 button keypad and want to 
perform validation on the commands as each character is typed.

It can be any project that accepts and processes characters one at a time (serial or keypad).

See http://statemachineprogramming.blogspot.com/ for the original article and full details about the example.
