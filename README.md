# StateMachineInput

Keypad Input Validation Using State Machine Programming on Arduino.

This code is meant to demostrate a powerful programming/logic technique.

If you aren't familiar with or haven't used state machine logic in programming, it is the 
easiest way to to break complex problems into manageable states and state transitions 
especially for handling serial input.

If you have an project that accepts commands using a 16 button keypad and want to 
perform validation on the commands as each character is typed.

It can be any project that accepts and processes characters one at a time (serial or keypad).
